        <p> <b>Summary:</b> Alzheimer's disease is an irreversible brain disorder that affects millions of Americans today. It usually starts with memory loss, and could progressively worsen into not being able to hold a conversation or do daily tasks.</p>
        <p>Currently, age is the best known risk factor for Alzheimer's. Individuals that are older generally have a higher chance of being diagnosed with Alzheimer's.</p>

      <div id = "Section">
        <p><b>Causes:</b> Although old age is believed to be the most common cause for Alzheimer's, here are also some others.</p>      
        <ul id="list">
          <li>
            <b>Genetics: </b>
            <ol id="doubleBulletPoints"> 
              <li>A family history of Alzheimer's does not guarantee Alzheimer's, but it will be responsible for a higher chance of developing Alzheimer's.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>A person that stays healthy as they age will likely not get Alzheimer's.</p>
            <p>In order to achieve a healthy lifestyle, <b>do the following:</b></p>
            <ol id="doubleBulletPoints">
              <li>Proper nutrition and a balanced diet</li>
              <li>Enough physical activity every day, this could be as simple as a 30 minute walk</li>
              <li>Social engagement: Humans were created to be social creatures. Social interaction can help a person feel happier, and also lower risks of dementia. This is because during socialization, memory and cognitive skills are sharpened.</li>
              <li>Sleep: Getting enough sleep is crucial for proper bodily function. A lack of sleep results in slower reaction times, loss of memory, and feeling tired throughout the day. Constant sleep deprivation over a long enough time period can cause irreversible damage to the brain.</li>
              <li>Interesting fact: High levels of education have been shown in studies to be related with a lower risk of dementia. </li>
